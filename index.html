  <h2>Dice Machine</h2>
  <p><a<!-- No link yet. Will look like "Title of site"--> </a></a></p>
  <p>Ever wanted to roll a six sided die but feel like a nerd while doing so? Using motion sensors, I created the code for this dice roller machine that, upon shaking, will select a random number from 1-6 after a short animation. This is a project from intro to programming and robotics, a class I took in 2020 during online learning.</p>

    <h2>Drawing game (With MIA RAUPACH!) </h2>
    <p><a><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/900826748">Drawing App</a></p>
    <p>Being paired with my friend Mia Raupach, we managed to create a shape generator with various functions - Drawing stars, custom polygons, circles, being able to erase, and more. We learned teamwork, scratch, programming principles, and most difficult by far - How to make a circle.</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>I love doing digital art! Itâ€™s my favorite pastime by far. This here is a digital painting of the ocean I am particularly proud of. Here I learned how to use different textures in the program I was using - As well as learning to draw motion, liquid, and clouds. The goal was to make it seem like a strangely aggressive painting with the warm colors and implied motion of the waves.</p>

    <h2>PYTHON Word guessing game (With AVALYN PHAN!) </h2>
    <p>This is a word guessing game that Avalayn Phan and I made for a project in computer science. The program first asks you if you'd like to guess 3 letter or 5 letter words, and after asking, the user is prompted to guess a word that is the same number of letters as the word. The program then searches through the guessed word and tells you if it is in the word, if it is correct in the right spot, or if it is incorrect. This trains the user to make inferences based on limited information. </p>

    <h2>JAVASCRIPT Temperature teller Project </h2>
    <p>This is a demonstration of my ability to use javascript to create a responsive program which can take in the temperature and return a response. The user tells it the temperature and the program responds by telling you if it is cold, normal, or hot.  </p>

    <h2> Micropython Pi Pico traffic light (ALSO With AVALYN PHAN!) </h2>
    <p>This is a Pi Pico project, which is a small computer that one might wire up to anything from a lightstrip to a speaker -- We managed to code in a traffic light which switches from green to yellow to red, back to green.</p>
