  <h2>Dice Machine</h2>
  <p><a<!-- No link yet. Will look like "Title of site"--> </a></a></p>
  <p>Ever wanted to roll a six sided die but feel like a nerd while doing so? Using motion sensors, I created the code for this dice roller machine that, upon shaking, will select a random number from 1-6 after a short animation. This is a project from intro to programming and robotics, a class I took in 2020 during online learning.</p>

    <h2>Drawing game (With MIA RAUPACH!) </h2>
    <p><a><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/900826748">Drawing App</a></p>
    <p>Being paired with my friend Mia Raupach, we managed to create a shape generator with various functions - Drawing stars, custom polygons, circles, being able to erase, and more. We learned teamwork, scratch, programming principles, and most difficult by far - How to make a circle.</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>I love doing digital art! Itâ€™s my favorite pastime by far. This here is a digital painting of the ocean I am particularly proud of. Here I learned how to use different textures in the program I was using - As well as learning to draw motion, liquid, and clouds. The goal was to make it seem like a strangely aggressive painting with the warm colors and implied motion of the waves.</p>
